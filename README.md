As an individual project of course Foundation of Software Engineering, skills used are listed as follow.

Tech checklist

	• Front-end: html, css, javascript(jquery lib), bootstrap framework

	• Back-end: javascript, OOP, sqlite, underscore JS lib, express.js framework

	• In between: socket.io


Areas of improvement

	• When the server restarts, all chatting history is gone, which can be super dangerous if the messages are important.

	  But for our use case, it should not a problem.

	• If time permits, add more fancy features such as to indicate which user is typing, to support choosing emoji and file transfer.
